# Medical_Image_Segementation_Based_on_Modified_UNet
A project about segmenting some kinds of medical images based on UNet. 

Structure of the network based on UNet

Result of some other kinds of images

After saving the models in local, an UI was designed to make the model usable.

Select what kind of image you want to segment, load the file and segment.

The performance was not able to be 100% correct or even not that satifying ,but I was out of money and time to try other kinds of structure XD.\

There was an Graphics tablet I have not used for long time, and it occured to me that how about modify the segmentation result with my own hand after the result is generated by model.

The results are as follows.

And this is the whole process of getting a segmentaion

There are still some defects in the system waiting to be improved, maybe later.
